# Excel Analytics Platform

Excel Analytics Platform is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to upload Excel files (.xls or .xlsx), analyze the data, and generate interactive 2D and 3D charts. Users can select chart types, pick X and Y axes from the uploaded data, and view/download visualizations.

The platform also includes user authentication, a dashboard to view upload history, and an admin panel for managing users and data. Optionally, AI features can provide smart insights or summary reports from the uploaded data.
